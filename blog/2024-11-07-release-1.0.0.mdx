## Version 1.0.0

Chickenbot release 1.0.0

<!-- truncate -->

### Description
Version 1.0.0 is the very first public version of ChickenBot!

ChickenBot is a standalone Windows Desktop application that allows you to start an automated Minecraft player:
We are talking about a ’bot’ here, or ’robot’ in French.

The main goal of this application is to allow a wide audience to easily create fun Minecraft bots.

In this initial version you can configure the bot with one or more functions:
- ’welcome’ function (max: 1): indicate the chat that the bot pronounces when it appears (or reappears),
- ’reply’ function (1 or more) one or more questions/answers: the bot detects a particular chat and responds with a particular chat,
- ’follow-me’ function (max: 1) ask your bot to follow you, or to stop following you.

This is a Freemium application. Version 1.0.0 is 100% free.
It is possible that in future versions, some (new future) functions will be paid.

Finally, here are some technical details and conditions of use.

The interactions between the application and the outside are as follows:
- depending on the configuration of the robot(s), exchanges with the Minecraft server(s) to control their connection/actions,
- sending anonymized statistics of the application’s use to a [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is/docs/cloud) instance.

Using the ChickenBot application means accepting these conditions of use and therefore the sending of anonymized statistics.
In transparency, the installation guide shows how to activate the debug and trace these calls.
The anonymized statistics are used to better understand the uses of the application, and to improve future versions.
