standalone Windows Desktop application that allows you to start an automated Minecraft player:\\r\\nWe are talking about a \u2019bot\u2019 here, or \u2019robot\u2019 in French.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main goal of this application is to allow a wide audience to easily create fun Minecraft bots.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this initial version you can configure the bot with one or more functions:\\r\\n- \u2019welcome\u2019 function (max: 1): indicate the chat that the bot pronounces when it appears (or reappears),\\r\\n- \u2019reply\u2019 function (1 or more) one or more questions/answers: the bot detects a particular chat and responds with a particular chat,\\r\\n- \u2019follow-me\u2019 function (max: 1) ask your bot to follow you, or to stop following you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a Freemium application. Version 1.0.0 is 100% free.\\r\\nIt is possible that in future versions, some (new future) functions will be paid.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, here are some technical details and conditions of use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interactions between the application and the outside are as follows:\\r\\n- depending on the configuration of the robot(s), exchanges with the Minecraft server(s) to control their connection/actions,\\r\\n- sending anonymized statistics of the application\u2019s use to a [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is/docs/cloud) instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the ChickenBot application means accepting these conditions of use and therefore the sending of anonymized statistics.\\r\\nIn transparency, the installation guide shows how to activate the debug and trace these calls.\\r\\nThe anonymized statistics are used to better understand the uses of the application, and to improve future versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Download\\r\\n[Download Binary](https://github.com/chickarmy/chickenbot-web/releases/download/v1.0.0/chicken-bot.1.0.0.exe)\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip[Info]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/chickarmy/chickenbot-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0)"},{"id":"chickenbot-web-creation","metadata":{"permalink":"/chickenbot-web/blog/chickenbot-web-creation","editUrl":"https://github.com/boly38/chickenbot-web/tree/main/blog/2024-10-07-chickenbot-web-implementation.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-07-chickenbot-web-implementation.mdx","title":"Chickenbot-web creation","description":"This is a  current work-in-progress on building chickenbot website using docusaurus.","date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"website","permalink":"/chickenbot-web/blog/tags/website","description":"About Chickenbot website"},{"inline":false,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/chickenbot-web/blog/tags/docusaurus","description":"Docusaurus website generator tool"},{"inline":false,"label":"dev","permalink":"/chickenbot-web/blog/tags/dev","description":"Development"}],"readingTime":0.325,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Boly38","title":"Open source contributor on GitHub","url":"https://github.com/boly38","page":{"permalink":"/chickenbot-web/blog/authors/boly-38"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/boly38","bluesky":"https://bsky.app/profile/boly38.bsky.social","github":"https://github.com/boly38"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/boly38.png","key":"boly38"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chickenbot-web-creation","title":"Chickenbot-web creation","authors":["boly38"],"tags":["website","docusaurus","dev"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release release 1.0.0","permalink":"/chickenbot-web/blog/chickenbot-release-1.0.0"}},"content":"export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (\\r\\n    <span\\r\\n        style={{\\r\\n            backgroundColor: color,\\r\\n            borderRadius: \'20px\',\\r\\n            color: \'#fff\',\\r\\n            padding: \'10px\',\\r\\n        }}\\r\\n        >\\r\\n    {children}\\r\\n  </span>\\r\\n);\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a  <Highlight color=\\"#25c2a0\\">current work-in-progress on building chickenbot website</Highlight> using docusaurus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n[docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) a modern static website generator.\\r\\n\\r\\nChickenbot Website rely on docusaurus to build the website.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can improve it via GitHub !\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip[Info]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is very-first test"}]}}')}}]);
